# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird, which moves to the right. The player is tasked with navigating through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. The bird automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. 
Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. Game designing and advanced features have been coded with Java language.
